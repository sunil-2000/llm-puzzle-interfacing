# Puzzle interfaces for language models


## interesting observations:
- gpt-4-vision seemingly cannot play wordle; does not make connections between
each row when making new guess <-- (better prompting?) <- need way to easily map char to token?

todo:
* stronger examples in prompts

- permutation of word ordering impacts gpt4 performance on connections
